==== RIG :: Database == [obsolete] =========================


# This section is no longuer maintained.
# These are just TODO notes, but items won't actually be closed.
#
# DB support is temporarily put apart. The idai (id-album-image class) branch
# is no longer in use. It works just fine with DBM or (of course) has dramatic
# performances with a text db. The id workflow wasn't clear enough to merge
# this into the main branch without making it impossible to maintain. But don't
# worry (or do, whatever serves you best), since the db support will come back RSN.


-- todo --

20021109 [3.N] DB: Add SQL driver (use generic SQL support for PHP)
20021109 [1.N] DB: Rewrite TEXT driver for better performances
20021109 [1.N] DB: Make db-drivers class instances
20021109 [1.N] DB: Introduce IDAI class (id-album-image class)

-- done --

20021108 [1.F] DB: Added DBA driver
20021108 [1.F] DB: Note: DB stuff currently only in separate rig-063-exp module



==== RIG :: Admin == [obsolete] ============================


# This section is no longuer maintained.
# These are just TODO notes, but items won't actually be closed.


-- todo --

20021109 [2.N] Admin: DB page to view current DB statistics

20020712 [4.N] Admin: Rename album (using db or ondisk?)
20020712 [4.N] Admin: Rename image (using db or ondisk?)
20020712 [4.N] Admin: Create albums
