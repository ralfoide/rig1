20030316 [1.N] RSS-Exp: Syndicate an RSS feed. (Of course, how come I haven't though of that before?!)
20030311 [2.N] Themes: make a specific subdir (other than src) for color themes
20030311 [2.N] Templates: make a specific subdir (other than src) for layout templates
20030311 [1.N] Groups: define behavior groups to grant users priviledges (guest, view, admin, translate)
20030220 [7.N] Manual: write real CODINGRULES.TXT
20030220 [6.N] Manual: write real INSTALL.TXT explaining site vs. album locations
20030220 [6.N] Manual: write real INSTALL.TXT based on CVS checkout
20030208 [2.N] Video-Exp: admin-video page to edit properties for one video file (currently: time of thumbnail)
20030208 [1.N] PNG: browse PNG files in dirs / simulate jhead-like info for display
20030208 [1.N] rig_thumbnail: add PNG support. use "libpng" (Debian packages libpng3 and libpng2-dev)
20030208 [1.N] rig_thumbnail: use "libjpeg62" (Debian packages libjpeg62 and libjpeg62-dev)
20030119 [4.N] Test: can the PHP code get the browser's window size via JavaScript? (for a full screen view)
20030119 [4.N] Templates: second display image template, with no link images and tiny header line (good for a full screen view)
20030119 [3.N] Templates: create HTML templates, using {keywords} instead of PHP code
20030119 [2.N] Templates: move structural html in template, not in rig code! (cf album/image tables)
20030118 [1.N] Cookies: don't store the full path in the cookie (stop at or before "index.php?")
20030118 [1.N] Cookies: use only one cookie for user+passwd (one admin, one normal)
20030118 [1.N] Cookies: don't store image size cookie if default size (remove existing cookie)
20030118 [1.N] Cookies: don't store a cookie for the guest mode (remove existing cookie)
20030112 [4.N] Merge all 0.6.3-exp code and discard this obsolete branch
20030112 [0.N] Idea is instead of hacking DB support in 0.6.3-exp, keep it for later when a class
               will be used to manipulate files. Also classify parts of the source code if useful.
20030112 [1.N] Document album/image workflow (i.e. when and how names are used)
20030112 [1.N] Class RigItem (struct mAlbum + mImage + helper accessors like is_image/is_album)
20030112 [1.N] Admin: Implement the freaking groups/users/password page for once!
20030112 [2.N] Make options XML files.
20030112 [3.N] Admin-album page vs Admin-image page (use these from 0.6.3-exp)
20030112 [5.N] Revise the TODO file structure -- separating Generic/Admin/DB doesn't really work for me.

==== RIG :: Video == [notes] ===============================


# This section is a repository of notes, not an action list.

	- Streaming server (Linux, Windows, multicast), Client (multiple OSes)
mPlayer:

==== RIG :: Database == [obsolete] =========================


# This section is no longuer maintained.
# These are just TODO notes, but items won't actually be closed.
#
# DB support is temporarily put apart. The idai (id-album-image class) branch
# is no longer in use. It works just fine with DBM or (of course) has dramatic
# performances with a text db. The id workflow wasn't clear enough to merge
# this into the main branch without making it impossible to maintain. But don't
# worry (or do, whatever serves you best), since the db support will come back RSN.


-- todo --

20021109 [3.N] DB: Add SQL driver (use generic SQL support for PHP)
20021109 [1.N] DB: Rewrite TEXT driver for better performances
20021109 [1.N] DB: Make db-drivers class instances
20021109 [1.N] DB: Introduce IDAI class (id-album-image class)

-- done --

20021108 [1.F] DB: Added DBA driver
20021108 [1.F] DB: Note: DB stuff currently only in separate rig-063-exp module



==== RIG :: Admin == [obsolete] ============================


# This section is no longuer maintained.
# These are just TODO notes, but items won't actually be closed.


-- todo --

20021109 [2.N] Admin: DB page to view current DB statistics

20020712 [2.N] Admin: Page to edit/reset passowrds
20020712 [2.N] Admin: Use crypt passwords

20020712 [2.N] Admin: Add an admin detail page: display details + options for one image

20020712 [3.N] Admin: Make preview buttons: Previews only, Images only, images+previews

20020712 [4.N] Admin: Rename album (using db or ondisk?)
20020712 [4.N] Admin: Rename image (using db or ondisk?)
20020712 [4.N] Admin: Create albums
20020712 [4.N] Admin: Upload images
20020712 [5.N] Admin: Move albums
