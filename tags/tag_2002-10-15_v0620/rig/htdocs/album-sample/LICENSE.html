<h1>RIG License</h1>

<p>This document describes the terms and conditions governing the distribution,

  under the terms of the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.html">Artistic 
  License</a>.</p>
<h3>1. Preamble</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package 
    may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of 
    artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users 
    of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less 
    customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Definitions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the 
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through 
    textual modification. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been 
    modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright 
    Holder. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights 
    for the package. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;You&quot; is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing 
    this Package. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis 
    of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You 
    will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the 
    computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, 
    though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that 
    recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they 
    received it. <br>
	
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
  <li> You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard 
    Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all 
    of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived 
    from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in 
    such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided 
    that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when 
    you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following: 
    <br>
    <br>
    <ol type="a">
      <li> place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them 
        Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an 
        equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site 
        such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your 
        modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with 
        standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate 
        manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how 
        it differs from the Standard Version.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.<br>

        <br>
      </li>
      <li> accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the 
        Package with your modifications.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> accompany any nonstandard executables with their corresponding Standard 
        Version executables, giving the nonstandard executables nonstandard names, 
        and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), 
        together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. 
    You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not 
    charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package 
    in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger

    <br>
  </li>
