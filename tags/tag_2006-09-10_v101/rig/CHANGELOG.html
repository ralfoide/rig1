<h3>RIG Notes</h3>

<p>Notes in 1.0:
<ul>
  <li>This is the last final version. It fixes a security vulnerability in the
  entry point that allows for PHP code inclusion and cross-site vulnerability.
  All previous version are unsafe to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes in 0.7.4:
<ul>
  <li>This is an intermediary dev release, with Polish translation by
  <a href="http://krypa.homelinux.net/">Alfred Broda</a> and some minor fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes in 0.7.3:
<ul>
  <li>This is an intermediary dev release, with one minor fix and one minor feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes in 0.7.2:
<ul>
  <li>This is an intermediary dev release, with some fixes & features.</li>
  <li>This version adds caching to the image & overview pages and eventually
  	fixes a dumb bug that was always invalidating cached pages when the cache
  	was reloaded.</li>
  <li>A new most significant feature is streaming of resized images via PHP
	instead of letting Apache serve the images directly from the cache folders.</li>
  <li>Consequently, it is also now possible to avoid placing all caches and sources images
  	under the document root. Instead data can be located out of reach of Apache.</li>
  <li><b>Important: When you upgrade to this version, you <em>must</em> review your
  	location.php file to adjust the data paths!</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.7.1:
<ul>
  <li>This is an intermediary dev release, with one minor fix.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.7:
<ul>
  <li>This is a stable version.</li>
  <li>License has been changed to a pure GNU General Public License v2.</li>
  <li>There are numerous little, insignificant and time-consuming fixes compared
  		with the latest stable version 0.6.4.4. Upgrading is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.4.5:
<ul>
  <li>This is an intermediary dev release, with some minor but useful fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.4.4:
<ul>
  <li>This is an intermediary dev release, with some minor but useful features.</li>
  <li>Although considered non-stable (low testing and new features to be added soon), this
  		release seems to perform very well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.4.3:
<ul>
  <li>This is an intermediary dev release, with some minor but useful features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.4.2:
<ul>
  <li>This is an intermediary dev release, with some minor but useful features.</li>
  <li>Some preferences have been added to enable or disable features (album descriptions,
  		album cache, viewing of hidden items.)</li>
  <li>The location.php and htdocs have been updated to be more flexible.</li>
  <li>A new folder is used to move admin sources out of the normal sources.</li>
  <li>Although considered non-stable (low testing and new features to be added soon), this
  		release seems to perform very well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.4.1:
<ul>
  <li>This is a stable version.</li>
  <li>This version does not technically add any feature, but it fixes a bunch of small and
  		annoying details.</li>
  <li>The code has been updated to comply with PHP 4.3.2 installation defaults: 
  		it works with register_globals=off and allow_call_time_pass_reference=off.</li>
  <li>This version also has been tested with IIS 5 and PHP 4.3.2 on a Windows box.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.4.0:
<ul>
  <li>This version features a completly rewritten installation guide.
  		Altough I consider the installation guide to be always obsolete (since it is always
  		updated <em>after</em> features are posted online), its reading should help a lot
  		people who are new to RIG. It covers how to compile the thumbnail application and
  		how to configure a basic site, including tricky parts like directories access rights.</li>
  <li>This version features a brand new album HTML cache generation: each time an album page
  		is rendered, RIG keeps a cache of it and serves the cached version next time the
  		same unchanged album is viewed. This greatly reduces the load of the server.</li>
  <li>This version was supposed to be the next stable one but further testing showed this was premature</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.3.5:
<ul>
  <li>This version introduces some new (minor but useful) features.
	  It seems pretty solid and is a good candidate to become 0.6.4-stable</li>
  <li>Albums has Grid vs Vertical layout, displays date of modification, etc.</li>
  <li>New "ignore lists" for albums/images (patterns of files to be ignored)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.3.4:
<ul>
  <li>This is an intermediary "dev" release (only CVS, no specific tag nor file download)</li>
  <li>Introduced support for videos</li>
  <li>Fixed broken album frame for Mozilla 1.0</li>
  <li>Support in-album "file_info.diz" or "descript.ion" files</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.3.3:
<ul>
  <li>Japanese translation completed by INOUE Tatsuo</li>
  <li>Some cleanup and fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.3.2:
<ul>
  <li>Misc fixes</li>
  <li>Preparation for upload feature</li>
  <li>Ability to translate UI via web interface (experimental)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.3.1: 
<ul>
<li>Mostly untested, but few problems are to be expected (modifications since 0.6.3.0 are fairly limited).</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes for 0.6.3.0:
<ul>
  <li>Seems fairly stable, although there's one known bug in the URL-rewrite option 
    (fails for cookies).</li>
  <li>The options are now stored in the rig-options subdir instead of the rig-cache 
    subdir. Consequently, you can either rebuild all options for your site or 
    use the hidden "fix options" function (it will read the old one and write 
    new ones, but it may fail to get the correct default thumbnails stored path, 
    since the format changed).</li>
</ul>
